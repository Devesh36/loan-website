    Education Loan EMI Calculator
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you apply for an education loan, you may use the
    <a href="/education-loan/emi-calculator.html" target="_blank"
      >Education Loan EMI Calculator</a
    >&nbsp;to figure out how much your monthly payments will be and how much the
    total cost of the loan will be. Enter a few loan-related factors such as the
    loan amount, tenure, interest rate, and processing costs to get an estimate
    of your equivalent monthly instalment (EMI). The total interest payable and
    a thorough amortisation table that breaks down your EMIs into principal and
    interest amounts on a monthly and annual basis are also significant pieces
    of information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a year, most lenders allow you to make partial prepayments on your
    loan. If you want to make such payments, use the calculator to see how much
    money you'll save on interest and how long it will take to pay off your
    debt.

    Tax Benefits on Education Loan
  </h2>
  <p>
    The interest you pay on your student loan can be deducted under<a
      href="/tax/section-80e.html"
      target="_blank"
    >
      Section 80E</a
    >
    of the Income Tax Act of 1961. This advantage is only available to
    individual borrowers and is only offered for the purpose of higher
    education. The deduction is available to all fields of study, both
    domestically and internationally. It includes both vocational and academic
    courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's important to remember that the<a
      href="/tax/tax-deduction-and-types.html"
      target="_blank"
    >
      tax deduction</a
    >
    only applies to the interest portion of the EMI, not the principle. There
    is, however, no limit to how many times you can claim this benefit. You'll
    need a certificate from your bank or financial institution that separates
    the principal and interest components of your EMIs to qualify for this
    benefit.
  </p>
  <p>
    This benefit is accessible for 8 years from the day you started repaying
    your loan or until the interest component is paid off, whichever comes
    first.

    Education Loan Repayment Process
  </h2>
  <p>
    The loan repayment period normally starts 12 months after completion of the
    course or 6 months after employment, whichever comes first.&nbsp;Applicants
    are given varied moratorium periods by different lenders when it comes to
    repaying their loans. You will be required to repay your loan in EMIs.
  </p>
  <p>Here are the different modes of repayments usually available:</p>
  <ul role="list" class="ui list">
    <li role="listitem" class="">
      Internet Banking - Pay online through the lender's website or mobile app.
    </li>
    <li role="listitem" class="">
      Cheque - Drop a cheque at any of the branches.
    </li>
    <li role="listitem" class="">
      Direct debit - Set up recurring payments for your EMI to be directly
      debited from your bank account on the payment due date.
    </li>
    <li role="listitem" class="">Demand Draft - Pay through a DD.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The preferred method of repayment varies between lenders. Therefore, it is
    advisable to check with your lender when taking the loan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Discussed below are a few important details in regard to the education loan
    repayment process:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Moratorium period</strong>: In the case of education loans, the
    beneficiaries will be able to start paying off the loan after the completion
    of the educational course or after successful employment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Part-payment of education loans</strong>: The beneficiaries of
    education loans will be allowed to make part payments towards their loans.
    As an applicant, you can pay back a lump sum amount to make part repayment
    of the loan.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pre-payment of education loan</strong>: If an applicant is able to
    manage the funds for the pre-payment of the loan amount, he or she will be
    able to do the same. However, it should be kept in mind that this
    might&nbsp;incur a processing fee.
  </p>
  <p>
    If money is the only thing standing between you and your professional goals,
    consider taking out an education or student loan to help you achieve them.
    You can receive collateral-free goals, which means you won't have to provide
    the lender with any security and your payments won't start right after
    graduation.

  <h2 class="ui header">FAQs on Education Loan</h2>
  <ol class="clearfix">
    <li class="mb-lg">
      <strong
        >Is the RBI moratorium on loans due to the Covid-19 pandemic applicable
        for education loans too?</strong
      >
      <p>
        Yes, the Reserve Bank of India's moratorium on retail loans, due to
        people undergoing financial challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic, is
        applicable to education loans as well. The moratorium on Equated Monthly
        Instalments (EMIs) could be availed from March 2020 to August 2020.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-lg">
      <strong>Do banks offer education loans without interest? </strong>
      <p>
        No, an interest rate will be levied by banks on education loans.&nbsp;
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-lg">
      <strong
        >Will I get the same amount of money on my education loan for the same
        level course in India and abroad?</strong
      >
      <p>
        No, usually education loans for courses in India do not offer the same
        amount as for comparable level courses abroad. Education loans offer
        higher amounts for courses abroad as fees and other expenses may be
        higher there than for courses in India (which also depends on the
        educational institution).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-lg">
      <strong
        >Is it possible to get an education loan without offering a
        collateral?</strong
      >
      <p>
        Almost all education loans from banks and other lenders require a
        collateral which can be fixed deposits, property, shares, bonds, etc.
        However, you can still avail an education loan without having to give
        any collateral. This can be achieved through the Credit Guarantee Fund
        for Education Loan (CGFEL) Schemes which covers a collateral-free loan
        of up to Rs.7.5 lakh. This is only for education loans dispersed under
        of&nbsp; the Model Education Loan Scheme of Indian Banks' Association
        (IBA). To avail this, you have to apply for an education loan under this
        scheme through a scheduled commercial bank. You don't need to provide
        security or collateral for amounts of up to Rs.7.5 lakh but anything
        above that will require collateral.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-lg">
      <strong
        >For courses abroad, is the loan offered in the currency of that
        particular country?</strong
      >
      <p>
        For courses abroad, education loans are typically paid directly to the
        educational institution in the local currency of that country.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-lg">
      <strong
        >Will the moratorium on education loan get extended if I choose to take
        a sabbatical from my course?</strong
      >
      <p>
        The moratorium period on education loans differs from lender to lender.
        However, it is usually until the borrower gets employed or for up to 1
        year of the course being completed, whichever is earlier. If you choose
        to take a sabbatical and want an extension of your moratorium, it would
        depend on the bank whether to grant it or not, so it is best to have a
        discussion about this with the lender.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-lg">
      <strong
        >Are NRIs eligible for education loans from banks in India?</strong
      >
      <p>
        One of the eligibility criteria for education loans that are offered by
        banks and other financial institutions in India is that the individual
        should be an Indian national. This means that any student who is a
        citizen of India can apply for and avail an education loan from a lender
        in the country. Collateral or documents which can be taken as security
        should be those that are enforceable in India.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-lg">
      <strong
        >What happens if I discontinue the course and get an employment within
        the grace period?</strong
      >
      <p>
        In case you choose to discontinue the course mid-way, you must start
        repaying the loan immediately after getting a job.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-lg">
      <strong
        >Can I port my education loan to another bank with lower interest
        rates?</strong
      >
      <p>
        Yes, you can move your education loan from one bank to another. However,
        your current bank might charge a refinance fees. Therefore, it is
        important to consider all factors of the existing bank and the new bank
        before moving the loan.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-lg">
      <strong
        >Do all education loans cover 100% of the education expenses?</strong
      >
      <p>
        Yes, education loans cover 100% of the education expenses. However, full
        coverage may only be provided for expenses under a certain limit.
        Lenders have a margin if the expenses go above the limit.
