          A car loan (also known as an automobile loan, or auto loan) is a sum of money a consumer borrows in order to purchase a car. Generally speaking a loan is an amount of money that is lent to an individual, a business, or another entity. The party that lends the money is known as the lender, while the party borrowing the money is called the borrower. When taking out a loan a borrower agrees to pay back the full loan amount, as well as any interest (a percentage of the loan amount, usually calculated on an annual basis), by a certain date, typically by making monthly payments.

          When it comes to a big purchase, for example a car, we often resort to loans for the financing of the same. Both personal loans and car loans are two of the biggest and most common financing options that are availed by consumers.<br></br>



          A Personal Loan can be used for any purpose. However, car loans are particularly available for car purchases. To have a better understanding, you can check the pros and cons of both the products.

          Pros:<br></br>

Car loans usually have a lower rate of interest.<br></br>
It is easier to avail a car loan.<br></br>
Since it is a secured loan, an individual with a mediocre credit score is also likely to be eligible for the loan.<br></br>
The vehicle itself acts as a security against the loan.<br></br>
Cons:<br></br>

You will be required to provide a down payment.<br></br>
The car will be hypothecated to the bank, and you will receive complete ownership only after all payments have been made.<br></br>
However, it is advised that you compare different loan products and then choose the one that suits your requirements.<br></br>

          If you have taken a car loan to purchase an Electric Vehicle (EV), you can now enjoy a tax rebate of Rs.1.5 lakh on the interest paid. This was announced in the latest Union Budget (2019-20) by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and is a part of the government's efforts to stimulate the adoption of environment-friendly mobility solutions.<br></br>

If you have purchased an electric vehicle, you will be able to avail a benefit of about Rs.2.5 lakh during the entire term of the loan. The government has also slashed the tax rates on electric vehicles to 5% from the earlier 12%.<br></br>

            Car Loan Versus Car Lease

          Financing and leasing are two methods through which people can get a new car. In both cases, the car owner/lessee would have to make monthly payments. The bank/leasing company would have a stake in the vehicle as well.<br></br>

There are several differences between car leasing and car purchase through a loan. Listed below are some of the differences:<br></br>

People who like to change cars every 3-4 years may find it more advantageous to lease a car as opposed to financing it. This way, the hassle of maintenance is also taken care of by the lessor.<br></br>
When the lease period expires, the lessee can return the car to the leasing company. He/she does not have to go through the process of car valuation and sale, as would be the case if he/she owned the vehicle.<br></br>
In the event of leasing a car, there is a restriction on the distance you can drive it for. These kinds of restrictions are not there when you are the owner of a financed car.<br></br>
Another disadvantage of leasing a car is the fact that you will be unable to customise the vehicle based on your personal preferences.<br></br>
